## Project Walkthrough

Every NFT challenge is it's own smart contract, and we have factory contract to generate these NFT challenge smart contracts.

## Run the project

    yarn install

    yarn run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Notes on Using V0

Majority of the front end project uses templates generated by [v0](https://v0.dev), an AI frontend component generator. Here's a list of components I generated for this project, you can play around with the prompts to modify the components.
